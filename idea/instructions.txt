A place where users can post their skills, other users will rate his/her skills...
Features:
1) Login / Signup via Firebase
2) There should be a list of skill categories that are already added in database by some one. Like, if I and you added 'PWA' as a skill, so right after login, user should see one of the category name PWA with a text '2 Persons'...
3) On clicking a category, there must come all the users of this category skill with their average rating stars.
4) On clicking any user, there must come all the users who provided RATINGS to him with their provided Stars.
5) User can also rate any one's skill except HIMSELF by clicking on + button (place it any where on this screen), there should be a popup for the stars, like HOW MANY STARS YOU WANT TO RATE?.
6) Implement PWA with a beautiful Responsive design...

Firestore structure should be like the picture attached 'rating-app.jpg'

You can continue my code if you're feeling any difficulty, but don't forget to add your project configurations and remove my one.!!! ;)
